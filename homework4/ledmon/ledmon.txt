This is a simple user-land tool for watching the LEDs on an Intel
e1000/e1000e based NIC.  Simply compile with "make" and run as root.
(As always, when someone says to run as root, please be sure to inspect
the code so you are sure that there are no security issues lurking)

NAME
	ledmon - watch LEDs on an Intel e1000/e1000e NIC

SYNOPSIS
	ledmon <bus:slot> [ethX] [-L]

DESCRIPTION
	Print the current state of the four LEDs on an Intel e1000/e1000e
	based NIC, as specified by <bus:slot> on the command line.

	-L	run in a continuous loop

EXAMPLE
	ledmon 00:08
		Show the current state of the ens3 LEDs

	ledmon 00:08 -L
		Show the LED states over and over, looping several times
		per second, so the changes can be seen.

	ledmon 00:08 eth0 -L
		Show the LED states over and over, looping several times
		per second, so the changes can be seen.  Also use the
		network interface (eth0) to determine link speed.  This
		option is only valid when the e1000/e1000e driver is still
		loaded. However, ledmon will still monitor leds if an invalid
		network interface is specified.

NOTES
	This is not useful for any other NIC.

	This must be run as root.
